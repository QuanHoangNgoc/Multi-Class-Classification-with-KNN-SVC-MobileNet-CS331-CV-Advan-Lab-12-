# MobileNetV1 on Caltech101

This project implements MobileNetV1 to classify images from the Caltech101 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained with different configurations to evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The **Caltech101 dataset** consists of 101 object categories and a background category, containing a total of around 9,000 images. Each category has 40 to 800 images.

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** MobileNetV1 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Additional Layers:** Fully connected layers for classification
- **Activation Function:** ReLU
- **Batch Normalization:** Applied for faster convergence
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross Entropy / Focal Cross Entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** ReduceLROnPlateau (optional)

## Training Configuration

- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 10+ (can be increased for better results)
- **Optimizer:** Adam (alternatives: SGD with momentum, AdamW)
- **Loss Function:** Cross Entropy / Focal Loss
- **Data Augmentation:** Random flipping, rotation, normalization (optional)

## Results

The model achieves significant improvements in validation accuracy during training, demonstrating its ability to generalize well to the dataset.

## Installation & Usage

## Future Improvements

- Implement data augmentation for better generalization
- Use a learning rate scheduler
- Experiment with different optimizers
- Train for more epochs
